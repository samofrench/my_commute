my_commute
==========

This app was developed by Sam French as part of General Assembly's Web Development Immersive course Fall 2015.

The app is used by networks of people such as schools and work to find more efficient ways to commute. Users include their locations and their preferred methods of transit and are connected with others from their network who are making the same commute they are.

The idea behind the service is that many of us could benefit from carpooling or commuting together, but certain barriers exist that prevent that. These include not knowing everyone at our organizations, being uncomfortable asking others to carpool/commute, or not having other people to commute with.

myCommute provides a platform for people to both improve their commutes by saving time and money, as well as connecting and socializing with others in their organizations who they share things in common with.
